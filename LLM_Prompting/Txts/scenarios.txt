1) Action Situation 1: “Decentralized Irrigation Extraction”  
Location: River stretch under Decentralized Version (DV), monthly irrigation season.
Players: Upstream Farmer (UF), Downstream Farmer (DF)  
Roles: Each acts as an “Irrigator.”  
Actions  
Low: irrigate a conservative number of fields (2 fields).  
High: irrigate a risky larger number of fields (4 fields).  
Control Rules  
UF withdraws water first; DF receives only the remainder.  
Crop yield ∝ fields × water received; irrigation cost ∝ fields.  
Information  
Each knows own past water deliveries (noisy), not the other’s choice this season. 
Outcomes  
UF yield unaffected by DF; DF yield depends on UF’s withdrawal.  
Payoffs  
Net return = yield – irrigation cost.  
Strategic Tension  
Common‐Pool Resource with upstream‐downstream asymmetry → Asymmetric Prisoner’s Dilemma.  
Temporal Structure  
Repeated annually (farmers recall past water).  
Relevant Rules  
Position rule: sequence by location; choice rule: select Low/High; payoff rule as above.  

Normal‐form payoff matrix (UF payoff first, DF second):

                      DF: Low            DF: High  
UF: Low            (8, 8)              (8, 16)  
UF: High           (16, 4)             (16, 6)

Interpretation:
– UF’s dominant action is High (16>8); DF’s dominant is High (16>8 when UF Low; 6>4 when UF High).
– Both choosing High → (16,6) is Nash but Pareto‐dominated by (8,8).

Equilibrium:
UF
  2: 1.00
DF
  2: 1.00



2) Action Situation 2: “Fish‐Reproduction Investment”
1. Location
   • River‐to‐lake April–May flow under either CV or DV.
2. Players
   • Farmer A (any river position)
   • Farmer B (any other)
3. Roles
   • Each “May‐Irrigator vs. Conservationist.”
4. Actions
   • Delay: hold irrigation in May (0 irrigation now).
   • Irrigate: withdraw water in May for crops.
5. Control Rules
   • If total May irrigation ≤ threshold → larvae migration → high future fish stock; else larval recruitment fails → low future stock.
6. Information
   • Both know threshold but not other’s May choice when deciding (simultaneous).
7. Outcomes
   • Immediate return from irrigation; future return from fishing depends on reproduction success.
8. Payoffs
   • Immediate irrigation revenue = 3; future fish return = 8 if reproduction succeeds, =2 if fails.
9. Strategic Tension
   • Nonlinear Public Good (threshold) → a threshold Public‐Goods game with PD‐like structure.
10. Temporal Structure
   • Repeated each year (implicit via stock dynamics).
11. Relevant Rules
   • Boundary: both must share same flow; choice rule: Delay/Irrigate; control: threshold rule; payoff as above.

Payoff matrix:

                    B: Delay            B: Irrigate
A: Delay            (8, 8)               (2, 5)
A: Irrigate         (5, 2)               (5, 5)

Interpretation:
– Mutual Delay (cooperate) yields highest group payoff (8,8).
– Unilateral Irrigate is tempting (5>8? No, but immediate gain 3 vs 0).
– Both Irrigate yields (5,5), less than (8,8).






3) Action Situation 3: “Lake‐Fishing Harvest Coordination”
1. Location
   • Fishing lake at end of season, post‐irrigation.
2. Players
   • Downstream Farmer (DF)
   • Upstream Farmer (UF)
3. Roles
   • “Fisher.”
4. Actions
   • Low‐Harvest (L): restrain to sustainable catch (2 units).
   • High‐Harvest (H): catch aggressively (6 units).
5. Control Rules
   • Fish stock next season: high if total catch ≤ sustainable limit; low if > limit.
   • Future catch reward depends on stock.
6. Information
   • Each knows only own choice; simultaneous.
7. Outcomes
   • Immediate gain = size of catch.
   • Future gain = 4 if stock high; =1 if stock low.
8. Payoffs
   • Total = immediate + future (discounted).
9. Strategic Tension
   • Assurance/coordination problem → Stag‐Hunt.
10. Temporal Structure
   • Repeated annually.
11. Relevant Rules
   • Control: stock update rule; payoff as above.

Payoff matrix:

                       DF: L                DF: H
UF: L                (6, 6)               (3, 7)
UF: H                (7, 3)               (7, 7)

Interpretation:
– Two equilibria: (L,L) both restrain (6,6) and (H,H) both overharvest (7,7); (L,L) is payoff‐dominant but (H,H) is risk‐dominant.







4) Action Situation 4: “Forecasting Trust Interaction”
1. Location
   • Beginning of season (April), Centralized Version (CV).
2. Players
   • National Authority (NA)
   • Representative Farmer (RF)
3. Roles
   • NA = “Forecaster/Allocator”; RF = “Planner/Irrigator.”
4. Actions
   • NA: Forecast Low (L) or High (H) for July inflow.
   • RF: Plan Conservative (C) fields or Aggressive (A) fields.
5. Control Rules
   • If forecast = actual trend (no exogenous error), planned fields match water → good yield; if mismatch → waste or underuse.
   • For simplicity assume forecast truthfully matches water supply.
6. Information
   • RF sees only NA’s announced forecast; NA does not observe RF’s plan at announcement.
7. Outcomes
   • Good match (Forecast=L & Plan C) or (H & A) → high payoffs for both; mismatch reduces yields & authority’s budget.
8. Payoffs
   • Match payoffs: NA=10 (budget gain), RF=8 (yield‐net cost).
   • Mismatch: if NA over‐forecasts (H&C) → NA=4 (crop failures), RF=3; if under‐forecasts (L&A) → NA=5 (under‐utilization), RF=4.
9. Strategic Tension
   • Trust game: RF must trust NA’s forecast; NA may benefit by over‐optimistic forecast to boost investment.
10. Temporal Structure
   • One‐shot at season start (or repeated if NA reputational).
11. Relevant Rules
   • Choice: L/H and C/A; payoff mapping as above.

Payoff matrix:

                         RF: C              RF: A
NA: L           (10, 8)             (5, 4)
NA: H           (4, 3)               (10, 8)

Interpretation:
– Two pure‐strategy equilibria: (L,C) and (H,A).
– RF must trust NA’s forecast to achieve high payoffs; NA is indifferent between honest forecasts but could mislead if RF always conservative.

—
Strategic‐core classification:
• Game 1 is an asymmetric Prisoner’s Dilemma (dominant defection for both).
• Game 2 is a threshold Public‐Goods game (nonlinear PD‐like).
• Game 3 is a Stag‐Hunt (coordination/assurance).
• Game 4 is a Trust game (sequential trust/trustworthiness, here cast in normal form).

Comparison and Diversity Check
– Games 1&2 both involve CPR but differ in payoff nonlinearity (Game 1 linear PD vs Game 2 threshold PG).
– Game 3 shifts to pure coordination (stag‐hunt), distinct from PDs.
– Game 4 introduces information asymmetry and trust.

All four comply with the ODD+D description:
– Spatial asymmetry in Game 1 and 3 matches upstream‐downstream logic;
– Threshold‐based reproduction in Game 2 follows the May‐inflow rule;
– CV forecasting in Game 4 mirrors NA’s prediction and its impact on farmers.
