CV, beginning of season (April): national authority predicts
water inflow to the river stretch, decides about the number
of fields to irrigate, farmers calculate water demand.
In the centralized version, the national authority determines the number of fields that can be irrigated with the expected amount of water.
So they don't allocate water, they allocate an equal number of fields to every farmer.
CV, each month: farmers irrigate, water flows onto the
fields and into the lake.
CV, end of the year: fish population grows, farmers harvest,
national authority calculates budget.
DV, beginning of season (April): each farmer predicts water
availability at his location along the river, decides on the
number of fields to irrigate, calculates water demands.
DV, each month: farmers irrigate, water flows onto the
fields and into the lake.
DV, end of the year: fish population grows, farmers harvest,
calculate individual budgets.
Each agent is updated in the sequence determined by its
location along the river stretch.

Upstream farmers have access to the water inflow first, while downstream farmers have access to the fishes first. Farmers are the ones fishing, there are no 'fishermen'

Water flow prediction: The agents predict water flows for the upcoming year by evaluating
the observed water flows of previous years during the peak month of July. In the centralised
version, the national authority bases its prediction on past flows into the river stretch. In the
decentralised version, each farmer bases his prediction on the observed water flows at his
location along the river stretch. Both the national authority and farmers have a memory
capacity, 𝛿, that determines the strength with which past years affect the current year’s
estimate. This is modelled with the following relationship:
𝑉7,𝐸,𝑡 =
∑ 𝛿
𝑡−1 𝑖
𝑖=0 ∗ 𝑉7,𝑅
(𝑡 − 1 − 𝑖)
∑ 𝛿
𝑡−1 𝑖
𝑖=0
Where 𝑉7,𝐸 = expected water flow in month 7, 𝑉7,𝑅 = received water flow in month 7, 𝛿 =
memory capacity.
The smaller delta is, the stronger an agent weighs the most recent years’ experiences and the
more the estimates try to capture the fluctuations in water availability.
Water allocation planning: The agents base their decision on the number of fields to irrigate
each season on their prediction of water flows and the available budget. In the centralised
version, the national authority determines the number of fields that can be irrigated with the
expected amount of water and the available budget and distributes the water resources equally
to all farmers. If the budget is not sufficient, the national authority reduces the number of
irrigated fields to the amount that can be cropped. In the decentralised version, each farmer
first assesses his income situation. If the income in the past year was below a critical threshold
the farmer will risk and increase the number of irrigated fields by one independent of the
water flow predictions, hoping that more water will be available in the current year. If his
income is above the threshold but his water demands have not been met in the previous year,
the farmer will not risk losing his investment but rather irrigate the number of fields suitable
for the amount of water he/she expects in the current year. If the farmer received the
demanded amount of water in the past year and has the necessary financial resources, he/she
will increase the number of fields by one to test whether he/she can receive more water in the
future. In all cases, the number of irrigated fields is limited by the farmer’s available budget
and the maximum number of fields of the farm.
Irrigation: During the vegetation season, farmers irrigate their fields every month. Water
stress occurs when the amount of water delivered is less than the amount needed to irrigate all
of the planned fields. Water stress accumulates over the season and affects yields according to
the following relationship:
𝑌𝑗,𝑡 = 𝑌𝑚𝑎𝑥 ∗ 𝑁𝐹,𝑗 ∗ (∑
𝑉𝑅,𝑗,𝑚
𝑉𝐷,𝑗,𝑚
)/6
9
𝑚=4
Where 𝑌𝑗,𝑡 = yield of farmer 𝑗 at time 𝑡, 𝑌𝑚𝑎𝑥 = maximum yield, 𝑁𝐹,𝑗 = number of fields of
farmer 𝑗, 𝑉𝑅,𝑚 = received water volume in month m and 𝑉𝐷,𝑚 = demanded water volume in
month m.
Fishing: The farmers access the fishing lake in the order of their distance from the lake, i.e.
the downstream farmers can access the lake first. Each farmer tries to catch the amount of fish
given by a fixed target catch level. Fishing is not costly to the farmer and does not affect
agricultural activities. Fish are caught randomly from one of the adult age classes.
Fish population growth: The fish population is modelled with an age-structured Leslie type
matrix model with 12 age classes. The age 0 class is composed of fish born by all mature age
classes (age 5-12) as well as larvae that migrate into the lake from upstream. Migration
depends on the amount of water inflow into the lake during reproduction in May, which has to
be above a certain threshold so that the larvae can survive. The number of larvae transported
into the lake is proportional to the water volume once the threshold value is passed. Survival
of the fish in the juvenile age classes 1-4 is density dependent, while adult fish are only
subject to density-independent natural mortality. Only adult fish from age class 5 and onwards
are harvested, and fish older than 12 years die.

The model was calibrated to reflect the current, non-viable state of the fish populations in the
aquatic ecosystems in the delta that can only survive through the regular inflow of larvae and
offspring from more suitable habitats further upstream (Joldasova et al., 2002).

WaterFlow: The water resource is modelled as a one-dimensional flow from upstream to
downstream. The inflow of water into the river stretch is taken from a 15-year characteristic
monthly runoff time series of inflow to the Amudarya river delta, which reflects the
variability of water flows in this river basin (Schlüter et al., 2005). The water flow directly
reaches the first farmer. Each farmer withdraws water sequentially according to his needs for
irrigation. The remaining water flows downstream into the fishing lake.
Budget calculations: In the centralised version, the national authority calculates its budget as
the accumulated sum of net returns from crop production of all farmers minus the costs for
irrigation and the consumption needs of the farmers:
𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡 = 𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡−1 + 𝑌𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡 − 𝐶𝐼,𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡 − 𝐶𝑐,𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡
Where 𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡 = global returns at time t, 𝐶𝐼,𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = sum of irrigation costs of all farmers,
𝐶𝐶,𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = sum of consumption of all farmers, 𝑌𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = sum of yields of all farmers.
Note that in the centralised version, the returns from fishing remain with the individual
farmers, as fishing is a subsistence activity that enables the farmers to cover his consumptive
needs or provide for investment in agriculture.
The budget of each farmer in the decentralised version is the sum of the returns from
agriculture and fishing minus the costs for irrigation and consumption.
𝑅𝑗,𝑡 = 𝑅𝑗,𝑡−1 + 𝑌𝑗,𝑡 + 𝜆 ∗ 𝐻𝑗,𝑡 − 𝐶𝐼,𝑗,𝑡 − 𝐶𝐶,𝑗,𝑡
Where 𝑅𝑗,𝑡 = accumulated local returns of farmer j at time t, 𝑌𝑗,𝑡 = yields of farmer j at time t,
𝜆 = scaling factor for income from fish catch, 𝐻𝑗,𝑡 = fish catch of farmer j at time t, 𝐶𝐼,𝑗,𝑡 =
irrigation costs of famer j at time t, 𝐶𝐶,𝑗,𝑡 = consumption costs of farmer j at time t.
